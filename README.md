# Learning Git & GitHub Through Practice

A hands-on repository for software engineering and machine learning students to master Git, GitHub, and DevOps fundamentals through realistic mini-projects.

## What This Repo Is

This isn't another Git tutorial with toy examples. Instead, you'll work with real project scenariosâ€”building CLI tools, processing datasets, managing configurations, and automating workflows. Each exercise simulates common development tasks where Git becomes essential for collaboration and version control.

## What You'll Learn

### Git Fundamentals

- **Repository Management**: `git status`, `git add`, `git commit`
- **Branching & Navigation**: `git switch`, `git branch`, `git checkout`
- **History & Inspection**: `git log`, `git diff`, `git show`
- **Remote Operations**: `git push`, `git pull`, `git fetch`
- **Collaboration**: `git merge`, `git rebase`, merging conflicts
- **Recovery**: `git revert`, `git reset`, undoing changes

### Professional Development Workflows

- **Feature branch development**: Complete professional development cycles
- **Code review processes**: Pull requests and collaboration patterns
- **CI/CD automation**: GitHub Actions for testing and deployment
- **Container deployment**: Docker for consistent environments and production deployment

## How to Use This Repository

### 1. Fork & Clone

#### What is Forking?

**Forking** creates your own copy of this repository on GitHub. Unlike simply downloading the code, a fork:

- **Creates your personal repository** - You'll have `github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/Learning-git`
- **Maintains connection to the original** - You can sync updates if needed
- **Enables independent development** - Make changes without affecting the original
- **Allows contribution back** - Submit pull requests to share improvements

Think of forking as getting your own laboratory to experiment in, while keeping a connection to the original research facility.

#### Why Fork This Learning Repository?

1. **Safe experimentation** - Break things, make mistakes, learn without consequences
2. **Personal progress tracking** - Your commits show your learning journey
3. **Portfolio development** - Your fork becomes a showcase of your Git skills
4. **Professional practice** - Forking mirrors real-world open source workflows

#### Step-by-Step Fork & Clone Process

1. **Fork the repository**:
   - Go to `https://github.com/ORIGINAL_OWNER/Learning-git` (this repository)
   - Click the **"Fork"** button in the top-right corner
   - Choose your GitHub account as the destination
   - GitHub creates `https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/Learning-git`

2. **Clone your fork locally**:

   ```bash
   # Replace YOUR_USERNAME with your actual GitHub username
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/Learning-git.git
   cd Learning-git
   ```

3. **Verify your setup**:

   ```bash
   git remote -v
   # Should show:
   # origin  https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/Learning-git.git (fetch)
   # origin  https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/Learning-git.git (push)
   
   ls exercises/
   # Should show: 01-basic-commit  02-branching  03-merging  ...
   ```

#### Important: Work in Your Fork

- **All exercises** should be completed in your forked repository
- **All commits** will be saved to your GitHub account
- **All GitHub Actions** (Exercise 6) will run on your repository
- **All Docker deployment** (Exercise 7) will showcase your personal work

Your fork is your learning workspace and eventual portfolio piece!

**Bonus**: Your repository includes a beautiful celebration website (`index.html` and `app.py`) that you'll containerize in the final Docker exercise to celebrate your achievements! ðŸŽ‰

### 2. Work Through Exercises

Each exercise in `/exercises/` contains:

- `developer_todo.md` - Your mission and required Git operations
- `project/` - Real code to work with
- Clear expected outcomes for local and remote repositories

### 3. Follow the Sequence

Start with `01-basic-commit` and progress through each numbered exercise. Each builds on previous concepts while introducing new Git workflows.

## Repository Philosophy

Every exercise here reflects real development scenarios. You'll:

- Fix bugs in existing codebases
- Add features across multiple files
- Resolve meaningful merge conflicts
- Collaborate on shared repositories
- Automate testing and deployment on your complete repository
- Deploy your learning portfolio as a containerized application

Think of this as your Git apprenticeshipâ€”learning through doing, not just reading.

### Final Achievement: Professional Portfolio

By the end, you'll have transformed your learning repository into a deployable web application that showcases all your work through an interactive interface, demonstrating both your Git mastery and modern DevOps skills.
